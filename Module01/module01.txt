"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in recruitment, particularly for
pre-selecting CVs. However, despite their appearance of neutrality, these technologies can
reproduce and even reinforce human biases. One of the main concerns about the use of AI
in CV sorting is the way it can perpetuate discrimination based on characteristics such
as age, gender, or ethnic origin.
For example, an AI trained on historical data could learn to favor white candidates over
50 years old if, in the past, this group was overrepresented in the positions to be filled.
The algorithm, based on this data, could conclude that this profile is the most likely to suc-
ceed, even if this simply reflects prejudices and discriminatory practices in the recruitment
process. This bias can manifest subtly, for example, by giving exaggerated importance to
certain experiences or training that are statistically more common among people in this
group.
Similarly, for positions perceived as traditionally female, such as nursing jobs, an AI could
favor women’s CVs. If historical data shows that the majority of people in these positions
were women, the algorithm could develop an association between the female gender and
success in this type of role, potentially excluding qualified men.
These biases are not intentional, but they are inherent in the operation of AIs that rely on
past data. If the training data reflects inequalities or stereotypes, the algorithm’s decisions
will be biased. It is therefore crucial to use diversified data and to set up bias correction
mechanisms to prevent the AI from reproducing discriminatory patterns. Companies must
also be vigilant in regularly evaluating the algorithms used in their recruitment processes
to ensure that these tools contribute to greater fairness, rather than perpetuating existing
inequalities.
In short, the use of AIs in CV selection carries risks of bias related to age, gender, and
ethnic origin. It is essential to take measures to ensure that these tools do not become
amplifiers of injustices, but rather levers to promote inclusion and diversity."

Translation:
Les systèmes d'intelligence artificielle (IA) sont de plus en plus utilisés dans le recrutement, notamment pour la présélection des CV. Cependant, malgré leur apparence de neutralité, ces technologies peuvent reproduire, voire renforcer, les biais humains. L'une des principales préoccupations concernant l'utilisation de l'IA dans le tri des CV réside dans sa capacité à perpétuer des discriminations basées sur des caractéristiques telles que l'âge, le genre ou l'origine ethnique.  

Par exemple, une IA entraînée sur des données historiques pourrait apprendre à favoriser les candidats blancs de plus de 50 ans si, par le passé, ce groupe était surreprésenté dans les postes à pourvoir. L'algorithme, basé sur ces données, pourrait conclure que ce profil est le plus susceptible de réussir, même si cela reflète simplement des préjugés et des pratiques discriminatoires dans le processus de recrutement. Ce biais peut se manifester de manière subtile, par exemple en accordant une importance exagérée à certaines expériences ou formations statistiquement plus courantes chez les personnes de ce groupe.  

De même, pour des postes perçus comme traditionnellement féminins, tels que les emplois d'infirmier, une IA pourrait favoriser les CV de femmes. Si les données historiques montrent que la majorité des personnes occupant ces postes étaient des femmes, l'algorithme pourrait développer une association entre le genre féminin et la réussite dans ce type de rôle, excluant potentiellement des hommes qualifiés.  

Ces biais ne sont pas intentionnels, mais ils sont inhérents au fonctionnement des IA qui s'appuient sur des données passées. Si les données d'entraînement reflètent des inégalités ou des stéréotypes, les décisions de l'algorithme seront biaisées. Il est donc crucial d'utiliser des données diversifiées et de mettre en place des mécanismes de correction des biais pour éviter que l'IA ne reproduise des schémas discriminatoires. Les entreprises doivent également être vigilantes en évaluant régulièrement les algorithmes utilisés dans leurs processus de recrutement, afin de s'assurer que ces outils contribuent à une plus grande équité plutôt qu'à perpétuer les inégalités existantes.  

En résumé, l'utilisation de l'IA dans la sélection des CV comporte des risques de biais liés à l'âge, au genre et à l'origine ethnique. Il est essentiel de prendre des mesures pour garantir que ces outils ne deviennent pas des amplificateurs d'injustices, mais plutôt des leviers pour promouvoir l'inclusion et la diversité.
