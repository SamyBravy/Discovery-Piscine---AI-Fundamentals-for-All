Slide 1: Introduction to Deep Learning

Title: What is Deep Learning?
Content:

    Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data.

    Inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, it excels in tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

    Key difference from traditional machine learning: deep learning automatically extracts features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.

    Examples of applications: self-driving cars, virtual assistants, and medical diagnostics.

Slide 2: How Deep Learning Works

Title: The Mechanics of Neural Networks
Content:

    Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data.

    Each neuron applies a mathematical transformation to its input and passes the result to the next layer.

    Training involves adjusting weights using backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize errors.

Slide 3: Key Architectures in Deep Learning

Title: Popular Neural Network Architectures
Content:

    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Ideal for image and video analysis.

    Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Designed for sequential data like text and speech.

    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Used for generating realistic data, such as images or music.
